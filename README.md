# Tick Tack Toe
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
For my project, I used the language Swift to create a classic Tick Tack Toe. My project contains 3 files GameView, GameViewModel, and Alerts. The GameView file contains the grid and design of the payer indicators like 0 and x and the game view consists of blue circles. The GameViewModel file contains a check for win condition or draw, and if AI can win, then win. If AI can't win, then block. Suppose AI can't then take the middle square. If AI can't take the middle square, then take a random available square. I chose to make this AI difficult to increase the game's difficulty. The last file Alerts contains the messages that appear when the person wins, when the computer wins, and when draws.
